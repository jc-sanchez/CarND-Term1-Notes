    "\n",
    "Goal od this lab is to demystify two concepts:\n",
    "* Backpropagation - process by which neural networks update the weights of the network over time.\n",
    "* Differentiable Graphs - graphs where nodes are differentiable functions. Useful for visual aids for understanding and calculating complicated derivatives.  TensorFlow is a framework for creating differentiable graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "With graphs and backpropagation, you will be able to create your own nodes and properly compute the derivatives.\n",

Each node will eventually calculate a value that represents its output. Let's initialize the value to None to indicate that it exists but hasn't been set yet.  Each node will need to be able to pass values forward and perform backpropagation."

    "Think of gradient descent as a ball on the slope of a valley.  In the ideal situation the ball rests at the bottom of this valley.  If we start off with random weights then this is like starting the ball on a random spot in the valley.  Our goal is to move it to the minimum.  At each iteration we find the gradient.  The gradient is the slop of the valley at the point where the ball is at. Then we move the ball slightly in that direction.  Eventually we will converge to a minimum.  The only issue is that it is not always the global min.  This concept can be extended to n dimensions.\n",
